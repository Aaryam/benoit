In February 2004, Mark Zuckerberg launched Facebook, a social media platform, along with his college roommates Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes. The idea for Facebook was inspired by a student directory at Zuckerberg's prep school, "The Photo Address Book," which students referred to as "The Facebook."

Just six days after its launch, Zuckerberg was accused of misleading three Harvard seniors into thinking he would help build their social network called HarvestConnection.com while he used their ideas to build a competing product. The lawsuit was settled for 1.2 million Facebook shares and 20 million in cash.

Zuckerberg dropped out of Harvard to fully focus on Facebook, and the team moved to Palo Alto, California. In mid-2004, they received their first office after receiving investment from Peter Thiel. Zuckerberg's goal for Facebook was to create an open information flow for people and make the world more open. By 2010, Facebook reached 500 million users.

Zuckerberg has been recognized as one of the top 35 innovators in the world under the age of 35 by MIT Technology Review's TR35 and named number 1 on Vanity Fair's list of the top 100 most influential people of the Information Age. He also ranked 16th in New Statesman's annual survey of the world's 50 most influential figures.

In the late 1990s, Elon Musk had a vision to revolutionize the financial world. He dreamed of creating a one-stop-shop for all of a person's financial needs, from checking and savings accounts to insurance and brokerages. In an interview with CBS MarketWatch, Musk proclaimed that "the Internet was ready to be the main financial repository" and that they were in the third stage of its evolution.

With this vision in mind, Musk began formally planning an online bank while still in the process of selling his company, Zip2. A month after the sale of Zip2, he co-founded X.com, investing 12 million dollars into the venture. X.com was run from a house before moving to an office in Palo Alto, California, with former Intuit CEO Bill Harris serving as its inaugural CEO. Within two months of its launch, X.com had attracted over 200,000 signups.

However, the road to success was not without challenges. Musk clashed with his co-founders, leading to the firing of one and the departure of the other two. But the real game-changer came when X.com merged with Confinity, its fiercest competitor. Confinity's product, PayPal, was a revolutionary way for people to send money to each other using the web. With Musk as its biggest shareholder and CEO, the merged company was called X.com.

However, the board of X.com voted to change the CEO from Musk to Peter Thiel, the co-founder of Confinity, while Musk was on his honeymoon in Australia. In June 2001, X.com was renamed PayPal. In 2002, eBay purchased PayPal for 1.5 billion dollars. In 2015, PayPal was spun off to become an independent, publicly traded company.

In 2017, Musk repurchased the domain name X.com from PayPal, saying that it had "great sentimental value". He relaunched X.com, consisting of a blank white page with the single letter "x" in the top left corner. In December of the same year, X.com redirected visitors to The Boring Company's website to advertise a hat sale.

OpenAI is a non-profit organization founded in 2015 with the aim of advancing artificial intelligence in a responsible and safe way. The organization was created with support from Sam Altman, Elon Musk, Greg Brockman, Reid Hoffman, Jessica Livingston, Peter Thiel, Amazon Web Services, Infosys, and YC Research, and has since then pledged over 1 billion to its cause. The organization is headquartered in San Francisco and operates with the goal of freely collaborating with other institutions and researchers by making its patents and research open to the public.

The first employees at OpenAI were handpicked from the best researchers in the field, who were drawn to the organization's potential and mission. Despite offering corporate-level salaries, the organization did not pay AI researchers salaries comparable to those of Facebook or Google, but the potential and mission of OpenAI still attracted top talent in the industry. In 2016, OpenAI released a public beta of its platform for reinforcement learning research, called OpenAI Gym, and later in 2016, it released Universe, a software platform for measuring and training an AI's general intelligence.

In 2018, Elon Musk resigned his board seat due to potential conflicts of interest with his role as CEO of Tesla, but remained a donor to OpenAI. Over the years, OpenAI has spent millions of dollars on cloud computing and training its AI systems, but its mission remains unchanged, to advance AI in a responsible and safe way. OpenAI's work has the potential to revolutionize the AI industry and have a profound impact on society as a whole.

Y Combinator was founded in 2005 by Paul Graham, Jessica Livingston, Robert Tappan Morris, and Trevor Blackwell. It started as a single program located in Cambridge, Massachusetts and another in Mountain View, California. However, as the company grew and invested in more startups, it became too much to manage two programs and in 2009, the Cambridge program was closed and all future programs were held in Silicon Valley.

In 2009, Sequoia Capital invested 2 million dollars in Y Combinator to enable it to invest in more companies. This was followed by an 8.25 million dollar funding round in 2010 to increase the number of startups the company could fund.

In 2011, Yuri Milner and SV Angel offered every Y Combinator company a 150,000 convertible note investment. This amount was later changed to 80,000 when the Start Fund was renewed.

In 2013, Y Combinator started funding nonprofit organizations, starting with Watsi. In 2014, Sam Altman replaced Paul Graham as the president of Y Combinator. In the same year, Y Combinator changed its deal for startups, offering 150,000 for 7% equity. Altman also announced partnerships with Transcriptic to support biotech companies and with Bolt to support hardware companies.

In 2015, Y Combinator announced the YC Fellowship Program, which was designed to fund companies at the idea or prototype stage. The first batch of YC Fellowship received an equity-free grant instead of an investment. In 2016, the program was changed and participating companies received a 20k investment for a 1.5% equity stake. However, the fellowship was discontinued in 2017.

In 2016, Y Combinator visited 11 countries to meet with founders and learn more about the international startup communities. In 2017, Y Combinator started the Startup School, an online course that released public videos and coached individual startups. Over 1500 startups graduated the program in its first year. In 2018, a software glitch led to all 15,000 startups that applied to the program being accepted, only to be rejected a few hours later. However, the outcry led Y Combinator to change its decision and accept all 15,000 companies.

In 2019, Geoff Ralston replaced Sam Altman as the president of Y Combinator. In January 2022, Y Combinator announced a new standard deal of 500,000. The summer 2020 batch was held remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic and in 2022, Y Combinator intentionally reduced the number of startups within its accelerator from 414 to 250.

In 2023, Garry Tan replaced Geoff Ralston as the president and CEO of Y Combinator.

JP Morgan has a rich history that dates back to 1854 when Junius S. Morgan joined George Peabody & Co., a London-based banking business. Junius took control of the firm and changed its name to J.S. Morgan & Co. in 1864 after George Peabody's retirement. Junius's son, J. Pierpont Morgan, first apprenticed at Duncan, Sherman, and Company in New York City and then founded his own firm, J. Pierpont Morgan & Company, in 1864. The company traded in government bonds and foreign exchange and acted as an agent for Peabody's.

Pierpont took on Charles H. Dabney as a senior partner, and the firm was known first as Dabney, Morgan, and Company, and then later as Drexel, Morgan & Co. In these firms, Pierpont used his Peabody connection to bring British financial capital together with rapidly-growing U.S. industrial firms that needed financial capital. The company was reorganized in 1895 and became J.P. Morgan and Company.

J.P. Morgan and Company financed the formation of the United States Steel Corporation, which became the world's first billion-dollar corporation. In 1895, the company supplied the U.S. government with gold to float a bond issue and restore the treasury surplus. The company was also involved in financing the New York, New Haven, and Hartford Railroad and made it the dominant railroad transporter in New England.

On September 16, 1920, a bomb exploded in front of the headquarters of J.P. Morgan Inc. at 23 Wall Street, killing 38 and injuring 400. The Wall Street bombing remains unsolved to this day, with the FBI file being rendered inactive in 1940 without ever finding the perpetrators.

During World War I, J.P. Morgan & Co. made a deal with the Bank of England to become the sole underwriter of war bonds for Great Britain and France. The company loaned about 1.5 billion dollars to the Allies and invested in the suppliers of war equipment to Britain and France, thus profiting from the financing and purchasing activities of the two European governments.

In 1933, the provisions of the Glassâ€“Steagall Act forced J.P. Morgan & Co. to separate its investment banking from its commercial banking operations. J.P. Morgan & Co. chose to operate as a commercial bank and in 1935, after being barred from the securities business, two J.P. Morgan partners, Henry S. Morgan and Harold Stanley, founded Morgan Stanley with 6.6 million dollars of nonvoting preferred stock from J.P. Morgan partners.
